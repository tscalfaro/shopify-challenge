Hi Shopify!!! (and potential future employers who might also be peaking at my github...) 

This is the completed backend challenge for the internship position. I have used a boiler plate, so you'll notice some unused code. I left this so I could come back and implement more into this project after being evaluated for the position. Now for the good stuff, I created the backend with javascript, express, sequelize, and postgresql. All backend code can be found in the "server" folder. I created a relational database for the products in the inventory system. The front end work is in the "client" folder, it is bare bones but I did use React. 

To get started, npm install from the root of this directory. Following this, you should create the two databases needed for the program to work on postgresQL. Both of these must be named accordingly "shopify-backend-challenge" & "shopify-backend-challenge-test". Ensure that psql is downloaded and running. Next, run the command "npm run seed" in order to seed the database with dummy products. Finally, "npm run start:dev" will get the application to open in localhost:8080 where you will be able to test the functions of the backend. You may skip looking at the localhost if you have a program similar to Insomnia that allows you to create request to api. All CRUD functionality is there.
