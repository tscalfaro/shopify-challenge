Hi Shopify!!! (and potential future employers who might also be peaking at my github...) 

This is the completed backend challenge for the internship position. I have used a boiler plate, so you'll notice some unused code, I left this so I could come back and implement more into this project after being evaluated for the position. Now for the good stuff, I created the backend with javascript, express, sequelize, and postgresql. All backend code can be found in the "server" folder. I created a relational database for the products in the inventory system, the relational part is not important because right now there are no relations but if I were to have chosen to do the "warehouse/location" or the "category" extra step then this would be very handy. Speaking of which, I added a deletion confirmation function to the basic CRUD functions. The front end work is in the "client" folder, I did used React just to give myself a basic UI. 

To get started, npm install from the root of this directory. Following this, you should create the two databases needed for the program to work on postgresQL. Both of these must be named accordingly "shopify-backend-challenge" & "shopify-backend-challenge-test". Ensure that psql is downloaded and running. Next, run the command "npm run seed" in order to seed the database with dummy products. Finally, "npm run start:dev" will get the application to open in localhost:8080 where you will be able to test the functions of the backend.
